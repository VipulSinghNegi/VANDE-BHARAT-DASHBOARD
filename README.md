Project Overview:

The Indian Railways Department is gearing up to expand its Vande Bharat train services to new cities across different operators. To facilitate this expansion, 
they aim to understand the workload distribution among operators based on the current running trains in service. With a history of launching 26 trains in India, 
the department seeks insights to identify the busiest operators and determine the number of trains each operator is currently operating. 
To address this need, the department has enlisted the expertise of a Junior Data Analyst to develop a Power BI dashboard. This dashboard will provide insights and
data-informed decisions by visualizing key metrics such as the number of trains operated by each operator, the distribution of trains across cities, and comparative analysis 
of operator workloads.providing unprecedented insights into Vande Bharat Trains.

Identified key operational insights, such as "Central and Northern" operators regions both separately managing 15.38% of trains.
Presented 3 important KPI insights, including Total trains and the Mumbai-Madgaon route having the highest operators occurrence at 7.69%, Total Operators, and the number of cities for analysis.
