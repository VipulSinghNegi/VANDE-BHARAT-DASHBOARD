Project Overview:
The Indian Railways Department is gearing up to expand its Vande Bharat train services to new cities across different operators. To facilitate this expansion, 
they aim to understand the workload distribution among operators based on the current running trains in service. With a history of launching 26 trains in India, 
the department seeks insights to identify the busiest operators and determine the number of trains each operator is currently operating. 
To address this need, the department has enlisted the expertise of a Junior Data Analyst to develop a Power BI dashboard. This dashboard will provide quick and intelligent 
data-informed decisions by visualizing key metrics such as the number of trains operated by each operator, the distribution of trains across cities, and comparative analysis 
of operator workloads. By leveraging data visualization techniques, the dashboard will empower the Indian Railways Department to optimize operational efficiency, 
and make informed decisions regarding the expansion of Vande Bharat train services.
